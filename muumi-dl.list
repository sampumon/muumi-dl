# Put here search or program URLs from YLE areena. Examples below.
#
# Format: areena_url TAB [target_dir]
# target_dir is ~/Desktop by default, and is created if doesn't already exist
#
# As what yle-dl cares, the page pointed to by URL has to have an RSS link for episode listing.
# All search pages do. Here some examples (uncomment to get these):
#
# http://areena-beta.yle.fi/ng/areena?q=muumilaakson+tarinoita	~/Desktop/muumit
# http://areena-beta.yle.fi/ng/areena?q=avara+luonto&sisalto=ohjelmat	~/Desktop/avara
# http://areena-beta.yle.fi/ng/areena/tv/1481524	~/Desktop/pasila
