# Put here search or program URLs from YLE areena. Examples below.
#
# Format: areena_url TAB [target_dir]
# target_dir is ~/Desktop by default and has to exist (or muumi-dl fails)
#
# As what yle-dl cares, the page pointed to by URL has to have an RSS link for episode listing.
# All search pages do. Here some examples (uncomment to get these):
#
# http://areena.yle.fi/haku//uusimmat/hakusana/muumilaakson+tarinoita	~/Desktop/muumit
# http://areena.yle.fi/haku//uusimmat/hakusana/avara+luonto	~/Desktop/avara
# http://areena.yle.fi/ohjelma/161995	~/Desktop/pasila
